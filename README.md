# Introduction FPL.lol

Build a FPL team by using SQL over FPL (Fantasy Premier League) data from https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League.

Try it out here, [FPL.lol](https://fpl.lol)

# How it works

- A [script](/scripts/getLatestFPLDatabase.mjs) to automatically convert FPL data CSVs to SQLite.
- SQLite + WASM to explore FPL data
- Share text and SQL queries without a backend, encoded as base64 URL.
